title: "Speedup of the computer"
---


On previous videos computer clock generator worked with 100uF capacitors.
I tried to speed up the computer by replacing them with 33uF.
As the calculation sequence is about 8 relays long (carry propagation in the ALU), there were some glitches at that speed.
However, division subroutine works normally with 47uF capacitors. Therefore this will be the fastest operation of the my computer.
