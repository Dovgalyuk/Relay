title: "Assembled ALU module"
---

I tested all ALU functions. Now it looks that everything is almost ok (except the heisenbug with subtract block). Assembled ALU is presented on the following photo:
![](/Relay/Photos/ALU-2013-12-15.jpg)

On this photo every relay is switched on and all LEDs (except one - which shows that result is zero) are turned on.

In this mode ALU consumes 4A of power.

Temperature inside the cabinet is about 40 degrees.
