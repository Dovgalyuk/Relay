[Relay computer "trainer"](http://relaysbc.sourceforge.net/).
The idea behind this project is to make a low relay count, single board computer similar to the single-board trainers of the early microcomputer era which can be mass produced for a reasonable price.
CPU part of this computer consists of 83 relays. Other parts are based on ICs.
