After last post in the blog I made the following modifications of ALU:
# All the brass plates were engraved, drilled, and cut.
# Plates were installed on the main board.
# Bought and installed plastic backside to the cabinet.
# Screwed two hinges for hanging cabinet on the wall.

And here it is! Completely assembled ALU:
