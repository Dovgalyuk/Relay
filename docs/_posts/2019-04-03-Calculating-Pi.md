title: "Calculating Pi"
---


I've finished soldering ROM boards (but not yet connected all of them)
and created a program for Pi approximation calculation.

It divides 355 by 113 and outputs the resulting digits into the register S.

I had to fix several bugs to make this program work:
* Two badly soldered diodes in ROM
* Two faulty relays
* Wrong ALU signal timings
