title: "Added teletype output"
---

Added decoder for the teletype at addresses 0x90-0x9f.

Only 4 lower bits of the data are decoded:

0-9 values are printed as digits, 15 is carriage return, and other values are not used yet.

There are some glitches yet. Probably because RC-chain is used to delay the enable signal.
