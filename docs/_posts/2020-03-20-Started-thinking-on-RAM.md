title: "Started thinking on RAM"

I plan to implement dynamic RAM based on capacitors.

There are several successful implementations already:

* [TIM](http://www.northdownfarm.co.uk/rory/tim/tim-8.htm)
* [YGREC16](https://hackaday.io/project/18757-ygrec16-ygs-16bits-relay-electric-computer/log/49877-capacitors-and-diodes)
* [more YGREC16](https://hackaday.io/project/18757-ygrec16-ygs-16bits-relay-electric-computer/log/56214-new-dram-array)

Now I rewired LOAD/STORE instruction decoder to make RAM implementation possible.
