title: "First hardware bugs"
---

I almost finished soldering of ALU adder module (and started using next 10m of wire) and found some strange bugs while testing it.

Some of them were caused by bad soldering (i.e. myself).

And others were really strange.
First one was caused by twisted wires inside the relay. I fixed it by switching inputs of corresponding pins.
