[Another one relay computer](http://www.schlaefendorf.de/relaisrechner/dokumentation/index.html).
This computer has extendable architecture and consists of multiple modules. It also uses semiconductor diodes for some logic operations, that is why it is not "fair" relay computer. But it's ALU is better than most of the other ones - it can execute 8 operations including SUB/SBC.
