[i² (i Squared)](http://isquared.weebly.com/) is a fully programmable 8-bit computer built of of relays.
It uses over 300 6v relays mounted on boards and has taken in excess of 1900 hours to design and construct. The design draws elements from several other relay computers built by Dr. Harry Porter (RC1), Jon Stanley (RC2), MCC (RC3) and Fredrik Andersson (Zusie).
According to the blog, work on this computer is still in progress.
