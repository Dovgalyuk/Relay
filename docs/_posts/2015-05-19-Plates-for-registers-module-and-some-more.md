title: "Plates for registers module and some more"
---


I finally made plates for the registers module.
The toughest part of making them was applying and developing photoresist.

I also got 40 new custom relays ($2.3 each, including shipping) from China.
Every relay is supposed to have white control LED. But I haven't tested them yet.

I've corrected the clock generator.
Now it makes 3 ticks per second. Full cycle consists of 2 ticks. Therefore clock frequency is 1.5Hz.
I used R = 100 Ohm and C = 330 uF for delay circuit.
