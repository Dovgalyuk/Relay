title: "Yet another relay computer build log"
---

"This [blog](http://relaycomputer.blogspot.ru/) documents my journey in constructing an 8-bit relay computer, from scratch, made from tons of solder, wires, lights, relays, sweat, tears, swearing and money.
The design of the computer is based on the one constructed by Dr. Harry Porter at Portland State University."
