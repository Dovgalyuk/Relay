title: "Wiring the registers"
---

For the several last weeks I used to solder the connections within the registers module:
* Made a cable for ALU and Registers file interconnection. I will use it for testing registers connection to data bus and latching the data from there.
* Wired all connections inside the register A.
* Started to wire register LR0 (or LR1? I'll decide it later).
